# Background

I saw this concept on reddit a few years back where people where people were visualizing how much of their life they've already finished. They did this with 90 rows of 52 columns. The rows represented the years of a person's life, and the column's represented the weeks that had passed. 

I thought this was a pretty powerful thing to look at, and I wanted to print it out on my wall. I tried to mock up a visualization in GIMP, but I floundered around for an hour before deciding I would just design it with HTML and CSS.

# Technical
This should be 99% responsive on all devices and screen sizes, and it will be hosted on https://life.studien.us . The app is written in reactjs, and I wrote some basic jest tests for this SPA. Additionally, I've set up a github action to run these tests on every push. I didn't go all out with this application just because it's simply a really small basic application. 

I'll probably do some UI changes to make it more artistic, so that you can print this out. Mark time periods with different colored weeks, and much much more.

This is what the app looks like right now as of 01/11/2024
